## 2D Cellular Automata with predetermined seed

This is a simulation of [Game of life](http://ddi.cs.uni-potsdam.de/HyFISCH/Produzieren/lis_projekt/proj_gamelife/ConwayScientificAmerican.htm)

This particular simulation has three methods for the Game of Life:

* R for Random (with a 50% chance of each cell starting alive or dead)

* B for By Flop (osciallator pattern)

* C for Crab (glider pattern)

This program runs in the command Console with the second argument in the argument vector as the number of iterations and the third argument to specify the pattern.
Example: java Sim453 500 R will run life for 500 iterations, beginning with a random initial pattern of cells.
